I am a Cyber Security Engineer living in Fernandina Beach, Florida.  I've been providing security solutions to SMB and enterprise organizations in the Southeast for over 15 years.  

During this time, I have been involved with the sale, design, and implementation of intrusion detection systems, next-generation firewalls, messaging, and endpoint security using machine learning & anti-exploit technologies.

Currently, I am exploring offensive security techniques and exploit development.
